# Algorithms sources codes
This is repository of algorithms source codes written in C++

## The content of respository:
### Matlab scripts
1. main.m << this is main script used for testing
2. neural_network.m << used for making neural network of all traffic signs
3. rcnn.m << used for making R-CNN (need to have signs_table which can be created from image labeler)
### Image labeler
Folder 'Signs' have pictures of all signs (now only stop and priority road signs) and this images is used for making signs_table from image labeler.
